#  About This App

## This app is based on AVFoundation's AVAssetExportSession.

## Using on Mac only. Apple's AV Encoding is much faster than FFMpeg.

## Usage: `[apppath] [inputpath] [outputpath]`.

## For example: `./SimpleVideoExporter /Users/zjj/Downloads/C0102.MP4 /Users/zjj/Downloads/C0102_output.mp4 `

## Output: 

```
